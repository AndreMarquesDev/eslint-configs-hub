# eslint-configs-hub

This repository serves as a central hub for my personal ESLint configurations. I used to maintain my own NPM package, [eslint-config-andremarquesdev](https://github.com/AndreMarquesDev/eslint-config-andremarquesdev), but found it challenging to keep up with updates and iterations. Instead, I've opted to use [@antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) as a base and override it with my custom preferences as needed.

**Why this approach?**

By using this repository, I can easily copy the necessary setup files when starting a new project, without the hassle of publishing and maintaining a separate NPM package. This approach also gives me more visibility and control over the rules I'm using.

**What's included?**

This repository contains my custom ESLint configurations for various projects, including:

* [React](react/eslint.config.ts)
* [Svelte](svelte/eslint.config.ts)
